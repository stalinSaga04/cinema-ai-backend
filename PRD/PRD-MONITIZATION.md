CINEMA AI – MONETIZATION RULES (MVP)

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Cinema AI does NOT charge for usage, access, or experimentation.

Cinema AI charges ONLY for exporting a final video.

---

## PAYMENT UNIT (LOCKED)

$7 USD = ONE PROJECT FINAL EXPORT

A payment unlocks:
- final render
- watermark removal
- duration cap removal
- download access

Payment applies to ONE project_id only.

---

## WHEN PAYMENT IS REQUIRED

Payment is requested ONLY when:
- a draft exists
- AI PAUSE is completed
- Creator approves the draft

Users NEVER pay:
- before seeing a draft
- before editing script
- before AI discussion

---

## WHAT PAYMENT DOES NOT UNLOCK

Payment does NOT:
- unlock unlimited projects
- unlock unlimited renders
- unlock subscriptions
- unlock system features
- unlock admin access

Each project requires its own payment.

---

## MULTIPLE PAYMENTS

A single user MAY:
- pay multiple times
- for multiple projects
- at different times

There is no expiry or time-based access.

---

## FREE TIER BEHAVIOR

Free tier allows:
- full analysis
- reverse script
- draft video
- AI PAUSE discussion

Free tier blocks:
- final render
- watermark removal
- export/download

---

## MODEL INSTRUCTION (MANDATORY)

Models MUST NOT:
- introduce subscriptions
- introduce credits
- introduce time limits
- bundle projects into one payment
- change pricing logic

$7 per project is LOCKED for MVP.

---


## Upload & Duration Limits (MVP)

### Upload Limits (Free Tier)
- Max total uploaded footage per project: 30 minutes
- Max number of clips per project: 20
- Uploading footage does not require payment

### Final Output Limits
- Free Tier:
  - Draft + preview only
  - Max 60 seconds
  - Watermarked
  - No download

- Paid Tier ($7 per project):
  - Unlocks final render
  - Watermark removed
  - Max final video length: 5–10 minutes
  - Download enabled

Cinema AI summarizes and directs footage.
It does not render hour-long videos in MVP.

-------
## Output Length & Payment Rules (MVP – LOCKED)

### Core Principle
Cinema AI charges ONLY for exporting a final video.
Cinema AI does NOT charge for uploading, analysis, scripting, drafts, or discussion.

---

## Upload Limits (Free Tier)

- Max total uploaded footage per project: **30 minutes**
- Max number of clips per project: **20**
- Uploading footage is always free
- Uploading footage does NOT guarantee final output length

Cinema AI analyzes all uploaded footage and selects the best segments.

---

## Final Output Limits

### Free Tier (No Payment)
- Draft video + preview only
- Watermarked
- Max output length: **60 seconds**
- No download/export access

### Paid Tier ($7 per project)
- One-time payment per project
- Unlocks final render and export
- Watermark removed
- Max final video length: **5 minutes**
- Download enabled
- No expiry or time limit

$7 applies to ONE project_id only.

---

## What Payment Does NOT Unlock

Payment does NOT:
- unlock unlimited videos
- unlock unlimited duration
- unlock subscriptions
- unlock system features
- apply to other projects

Each project requires its own payment.

---

## Business Positioning (IMPORTANT)

Cinema AI is an **AI Video Director**, not a long-form editor.

The system:
- summarizes footage
- directs the story
- produces concise final videos

Hour-long outputs are explicitly out of scope for MVP.

---

## Model Enforcement Rules

Models MUST NOT:
- increase duration limits
- introduce unlimited output
- add subscriptions or credits
- bundle multiple projects into one payment
- reduce limits without instruction

Paid tier duration = **5 minutes** is LOCKED for MVP.

---

✅ END OF OUTPUT & PAYMENT PRD
------
## Multi-Video & Multi-Frame Input Handling (LOCKED)

Cinema AI supports uploading multiple video files per project.

All uploaded videos are treated as a single footage pool.

Frames and scenes are used ONLY for analysis and decision-making.

---

## Output Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Regardless of how many videos or frames are uploaded:

- ONE project produces:
  - ONE draft video (free tier)
  - ONE final video (paid tier)

Cinema AI does NOT produce:
- multiple outputs per project
- per-clip edited videos
- per-frame outputs

---

## Project Boundary Rule

If a user wants multiple final videos:
- they MUST create multiple projects
- each project is analyzed and paid independently

This rule is mandatory and must not be bypassed.
----
## Preview vs Final Output (LOCKED)

Cinema AI preview videos are NOT random excerpts.

A preview is a compressed representation of the full final video.

---

## Preview Rules (Free Tier)

- Max preview length: 30–60 seconds
- Preview uses the SAME:
  - scene order
  - narration style
  - music
  - transitions
- Preview selects representative segments from ALL sections

Preview pacing may be faster, but structure must match final output.

---

## User Expectation Guarantee

If a user approves the preview and script:
- the final video MUST follow the same structure
- the final video MUST feel like an extended version of the preview

No stylistic surprises are allowed after approval.
